# Task Board

## Description

This project is a task board. From clicking the green 'Add Task' button you can then create a task. The task can have a title a description and a due date. As you are making your todo list you can drag which one you would like to a new column. There are 3 sections. Once it is is done you can drag it to done! If you no longer need to do a task you can simply click the red 'delete' button and then it will disappear from your Task Board. It is a great app to help you stay organized.
